testdroidarabicnaskh
==========

testdroidarabicnaskh is a modification testroboto, in turn
a modification of Soma FontFriend, cut down to simply test a 
single font family.

To customize, edit these 3 files:

font-friend-dev.js
font-friend.css
font-friend.html

Then rebuild the final file, font-friend.js, with 

$ php build.php

To use it, upload it to eg http://your-site.com/font-friend.js 
and replace that URL in the link found in bookmarklet.js and then
add that link as a bookmark.
